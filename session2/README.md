# Session 2: Storage made Simple

## Overview

Now that you know how to provision an EC2 instance, it's time to understand the various storage options accessible from your instance — and any other AWS services.

## What you will learn
* Set up an S3 bucket
* Configure the S3 bucket correctly for secured access
* Set up a static website with S3
* Encrypt your S3 bucket

## Materials

> If you are completely new to AWS or cloud computing, please start with the introductory resources first. You can find them on the main page.

* **Udemy Course:**  Section 12: Amazon S3 Introduction, all videos (approx 1h), and optionally, Section 7: EC2 Instance Storage, all videos (approx 1h). You can access the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/) through [CSC's Learn App](https://learn.gov.sg/).

<!-- ## Hands-on Session

> Find the slides for the hands-on session [here](#)

For this hands-on session, we will be mainly following [Chris Albon's walkthrough](https://chrisalbon.com/aws/basics/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/) on running Jupyter Notebook on EC2. We have added on a few other steps to cover some finer points about EC2 as well.

**Follow these steps for the hands-on session:**

* Spin up an EC2 instance using the AWS Console
* Expose your EC2 instance to the Internet, but only to your IP address
* SSH (tunnel) into your EC2 instance remotely
* Install Jupyter Notebook and configure it for remote access
* Test your setup by running code on your Jupyter Notebook
* Stop (not terminate) and restart your instance
* Tear down all the resources correctly using the AWS Console

**Why is this useful?**
* Covers the basics of creating, accessing, securing and encrypting the various types of storage.
* Having configured your storage, you can use it to store data just as you would on an on-prem server, or your local computer — but with finer control over access permissions, reliability, speed, and cost. -->
