# Session 3: Nasty Networking

## Overview

Networking is truly one of the hardest parts of any technology infrastructure. You need a good understanding of both the details (ports, protocol, speeds etc) and of the big picture (topology, private networks, firewalls etc). AWS's advanced certificate on networking is notorious for being the hardest and rarest certification.

Thankfully, nobody is expected to be a *network nerd*. Just knowing enough of the basics to ask the right questions is all we're aiming for in this section. We will go through the basic concepts for general networking before discussing how these translate into the AWS cloud environment.

## What you will learn

* Introductory concepts for networking
* What networking on AWS looks like
* How networking affects our deployment architectures
