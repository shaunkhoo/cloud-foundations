## Materials

### Introductory Materials

If you are completely new to AWS or cloud computing, we highly recommend that you look through the following materials before we start our first session. This will give you a good high-level and conceptual overview of key cloud computing concepts and of AWS's most important products.

* [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=60697): Useful and intuitive explanations for key AWS products and cloud computing concepts.

### Udemy Course

For this training, we will primarily rely on Stephane Maarek's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/) for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. It covers all the key topics comprehensively, and provides hands-on videos for some AWS products as well. Before each session, we will ask you to watch specific videos from the course to get a good theoretical understanding before the hands-on session.

This is available for **free** via [CSC's Learn App](https://learn.gov.sg/)!

### Other Materials

Here are some additional useful articles or links if you're interested in going deeper into specific topics.

* [Missing Semester (MIT)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/): Excellent lectures on mastering the Linux shell. Highly recommend the ones on the shell (week 1), the editor (week 3), and Git (week 6).
