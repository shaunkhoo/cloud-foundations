# Session 2: Storage made Simple

## Overview

Now that you know how to provision an EC2 instance, it's time to understand the various storage options accessible from your instance — and any other AWS services.

## What you will learn
* Set up an S3 bucket
* Use versioning in the S3 bucket
* Encrypt objects in the S3 bucket
* Upload and download from S3 with Boto3
* Configure the S3 bucket for public access
* Set up a static website with S3


## Materials

> If you are completely new to AWS or cloud computing, please start with the introductory resources first. You can find them on the main page.

## Hands-on Session

> Find the slides for the hands-on session [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19suCETn2IbpwLgZHh75bBzp56IqKCdElGk1vPZAdmr4/edit?usp=sharing)

<!-- **Follow these steps for the hands-on session:**

* Spin up an EC2 instance using the AWS Console
* Expose your EC2 instance to the Internet, but only to your IP address
* SSH (tunnel) into your EC2 instance remotely
* Install Jupyter Notebook and configure it for remote access
* Test your setup by running code on your Jupyter Notebook
* Stop (not terminate) and restart your instance
* Tear down all the resources correctly using the AWS Console -->

**Why is this useful?**
* Covers the basics of creating, accessing, securing and encrypting the various types of storage.
* Having configured your storage, you can use it to store data just as you would on an on-prem server, or your local computer — but with finer control over access permissions, reliability, speed, and cost.
